# Could we...? #

Shortly after Project Thunder Snow first went live in January 2011, I've not been able to spend any large blocks of time similarly to when I first created it. So, if you have had correspondence with me in the past in regards to particular requests, things really have not changed.

I'm going to list a few F.R.I.'s (frequently requested items) as they come so as to not forget them. There are no guarantees as to when/if any of these would be done. I still highly recommend that you develop a relationship with a flash or flex programmer.

R.F.I.'s ( requests for information ) from your developer or development department can be satisfied much quicker that requesting me to help out with your online presence.

Thanks again for your interest in project thunder snow.
