A Multimedia engine and transcoding framework for playing audio, visual, and scripted-data streams from any networked resource. Designed to run indefinitely without memory overflow.

From the beginning, with P.T.S. I set out to do the 'impossible'. As simple as the no-nonsense 'nothing but AAC' player, to a fully scripted song-title-change response system, there really is no limit how you can skin the core.


**Recommendation**

I recommend to use NBAcc as a starting point. The view framework never received the love it required to really work easily. I also caught wind of a developer who tried to use it and failed to deliver. Whether or not it was a contributing factor to the over all deliverable, I know it is a PITA.


**'Impossible' Project Goals**
  1. Never crash the flash player by running out of memory during a radio stream.
  1. Play NSV video content with subtitles and auxiliary audio channels support.
  1. Play AACP content in flash from shoutcast radio servers without wowza or Red5.
  1. Get the metaint title data in-stream and parse it out.
  1. Dump Media from NSV containers to FLV containers and save to local disk.

I had been advising several people on how such operations would be done. Organizations large and small asked how to accomplish the above goals but none of them were willing to invest in the development. In December of 2010 I began the project and initially released it under C.C non-commercial license in the first week of January 2011. After a year and more of letting the core-lib sit around and unable to support clients, I decided to change the license and host it where there will be more exposure to those( you! ) who would make the most out of it. Thanks again for your interest in Project Thunder Snow.
